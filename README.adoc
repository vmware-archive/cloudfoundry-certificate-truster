`CloudFoundryCertificateTruster` will download certificates
and add them to the JVM truststore at the earliest possible time.

== Dependencies

Include the dependency in your Spring Boot project to activate the certificate truster.

=== Maven

[source,xml]
----
<dependency>
  <groupId>io.pivotal.spring.cloud</groupId>

This will cause `CloudFoundryCertificateTruster` to download the certificate at api.my-cf-domain.com:443 and add
it to the JVM's truststore.

Multiple URLs can be specified using comma (,) as a delimiter.

NOTE: The timeout for certificate download is 5 seconds. If any errors occur, they are printed to System.err.
